Table: Calls

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| from_id     | int     |
| to_id       | int     |
| duration    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table does not have a primary key, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id


###PROBLEM:

Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration 
between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2.

Return the result table in any order.

###SOLUTION:

SELECT from_id as person1, 
        to_id as person2,
        COUNT(to_id) as call_count,
        SUM(duration) as total_duration
FROM calls
GROUP BY CASE
            WHEN from_id < to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END,
         CASE
            WHEN from_id > to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END
