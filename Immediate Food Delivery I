Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders 
at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

###PROBLEM:
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, 
then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

###SOLUTION:

SELECT ROUND(SUM(IF(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date,1,0))/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM delivery)*100,2) as immediate_percentage
FROM delivery
